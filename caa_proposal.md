Dear honourable members of the CAA Steering Committee,

With this letter, we would like to express our intention to establish a CAA Special Interest Group (SIG) on `Semantics and LOUD in Archaeology` (SIG-DataDragon) under the auspices of the CAA international. The idea for this SIG was developed in 2019 in a session on Linked Open Data (LOD) in archaeology. Out of this event and the resulting discussions, it was proposed to form such a Special Interest Group to create a permanent platform for the exchange and discussion of ideas and to develop the practical use of LOD for archaeological applications. After further discussions with colleagues, it became clear that it would be a good idea to extend the focus to all samanrics and application interfaces.

 The SIG already exists de facto with a Website (http://datadragon.link), a Github organisation (https://github.com/caa-datadragons) and its active members. For the CAA 2020, we would now like to propose to formally include this SIG in the canon of the SIGs of the CAA. We also have a session on Linked Data where new members of the SIG can inscribe.

## Statement of purpose

The purpose of the CAA Special Interest Groupon `Semantics and LOUD in Archaeology` (SIG-DataDragon) is ...

> to promote the widespread implementation of computer scripts in archaeology. We will provide an exchange platform for scientists in and around archaeology who use scripting languages to conduct major or minor parts of their research. Scripts are computer programs that automate the execution of various kinds of tasks and are typically used by scientists to process and visualize information in ways that are amenable to the principles of open research. The purpose of this SIG is to help foster the growing community of archaeologists who increasingly use scientific scripting languages to pursue archaeological interests.

> This SIG is particularly supportive of students and early career researches who may be interested in developing their skills and promoting more pervasive use of scientific scripting languages in research, publication and teaching. By promoting the widespread adoption of practical technological skills, we hope to establish a robust community of practice that may serve as a foundation for further growth.

> The SIG is an open format that supports discussion and the circulation of ideas drawn from various perspectives. Everyone may participate on equal terms, following CAA International's established Ethics Policy. To ensure expedient and civil discourse, the SIG committee will remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this policy. To be as inclusive as possible and also for the sake of reproducibility, we strongly prefer open-source over proprietary software.

### ...

If you approve the formation of this SIG, we would also like to ask you if and how the SIG could get a short slot in the schedule of the CAA2020 conference in Oxford to discuss the organisational affairs among new and established members.

Thank you for considering this proposal.

With best regards,

Florian Thiery, Ethan Gruber, Martina Trognitz
